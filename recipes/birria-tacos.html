    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The best cut of beef, beef shank... with Guajillo Peppers, Chipotle Peppers mixed with some Mexican Oregano.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef shank</li>
        <li>Guajillo peppers</li>
        <li>Chipole peppers</li>
        <li>Adobo seasoning</li>
        <li>Mexican oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the peppers. Bring a pot of water to a boil and then take it off the heat, soak the dried peppers while you do the next steps.</li>
        <li>Season the meat. While you wait for the peppers to soak, cube up the roast and season the meat with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Make the marinade. Throw together everything left except the cloves, bay leaves, and cinnamon into a blender. Remove the peppers from the now warm water and let them get cool enough to handle. </li>
        <li>Marinate the beef overnight. Two hours is good enough too, but longer is always better when it comes to stews.</li>
        <li>Make the stew. Saute the onions. Onions are the base of all flavor, so make sure they are extra delicious – transparent and golden. Take your time. Then add the meats, cover with chicken stock, and add the last few spices. That’s all there is to it!</li>
    </ol>
